temp.m creates the frequency plots of durations from the long-period two cell simulations from project4AvRon.m
Project4AvRon.m has been modified to have differnt threshold probabilties for activation of Iext, and longer total simulation duration
Project1AvRon.m has been modified to incorporate the different timed signals and superimpose them to determine refractory period
Project4AvRon v2.m has been modified to produce the graphs that indicate the cessation of synchronous activation due to Iext
